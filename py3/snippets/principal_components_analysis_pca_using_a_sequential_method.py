# Hotelling's T2 values

# And we should also plot the scores:
pylab.figure()
pylab.plot(nipals_T[:,0], nipals_T[:,1], '.')

# Confirm the outliers in the raw data, giving one extra point above and below
raw[37:41,:]
raw[109:112,:]

# Next step for you: exclude observation 38, 39, 110 and 154 and 
# rebuild the PCA model. Can you interpret what the loadings, nipals_P, mean?

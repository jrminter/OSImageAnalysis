Step 2: Mount using standard metallographic practice [l-3]. Either an epoxy, cold mount, Bakelite or in some cases fusible metal alloy should be employed. Although a specimen itself may be conducting (e. g., an alloy steel), it may be useful to mount the specimen in a conductive epoxy to prevent charging during examination.

Step 3: Polish using standard metallographic practice [1-6] and appropriate polishing compounds. A typical grinding and polishing sequence might be 320, 400, 600 SiC papers followed by 3 um, 1 um, 0.25 um alumina or diamond polishing compounds. This work may be done by hand or by using rotating wheels. Be sure to carefully clean the entire mount in soap and water before moving to the next smaller polishing compound.

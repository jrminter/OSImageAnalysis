Dear Dr. Ritchie, 

I have a working simulation using DTSA2. The one problem that I have is that I cannot store the spectra to disk - the WriteSpectrumAsEMSA1_0.write() complains that it doesn't like "0" (from your examples) for the third argument. I tried False and it didn't like that either.... 

I am attaching my script hoping that you might take a quick note and let me know if there is anything I should do differently. I'd like to extend this and look at models of spheroidal particles on C supports to see how quickly an increase in diameter shows up in attenuation of the O peak caused by mass absorption by the Ag. 

Thanks again, 
Best Regards, 
John R. Minter

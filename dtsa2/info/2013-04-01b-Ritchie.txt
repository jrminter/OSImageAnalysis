The trick is the import module mcSimulate3.py.  There is a function called “multiFilm” that makes simulating films simple.  mcSimulate3 is located in the “Lib\dtsa2” directory in the DTSA-II install directory (usually in “C:\Users\You\AppData\Local\NIST\DTSA-II_Gemini” or some such.)

Thank you for your hard work on DTSA-II. 

I was hoping to used DTSA-II to simulate EDS spectra from films of increasing thickness of Ag2O on top of a 100 nm C film. It seems that one should be able to do this with a script, but I have not yet been able to figure out how. I'd appreciate some pointers... 
Best Regards,

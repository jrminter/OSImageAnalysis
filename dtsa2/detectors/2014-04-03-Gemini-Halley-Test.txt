0. I am using java1.7.0_51 (64 bit) on Win 7 Pro x64 SP1
1. Un-installed Halley
2. Deleted the gov javasoft key from registry
3. Deleted the report and database files from my report directory (C:\Data\eds\dtsa)
4. Installed 2012-11-15 DTSA-II Gemini (C:\Apps\dtsa\Gemini)
5. Set default detectors for FIB-620 and CM20UT by importing spectra and using parameters from my text file and selecting 4096 channels.
6. Tried calibrating both detectors. No issues.

7. Uninstall Gemini
8. Install Halley
9. Calibrate FIB-620 with same spectrum as Gemini. No probs
10. Calibrate CM20UT with same spectrum as Gemini. java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 4096

Go figure...

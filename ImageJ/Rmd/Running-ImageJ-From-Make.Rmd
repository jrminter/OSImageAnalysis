We want to use ``Gnu make`` to reproducibly process images with Fiji/ImageJ in the ``headless`` mode. Here we describe an approach that works on Windows, Linux, and MacOSX from a common code base. Getting this working on Windows was most difficult, so we present that as the base method.

## Install the Java Virtual Machines properly.

We will need to use environment variables and path names including spaces has caused errors. One needs to select a custom directory durning the installation process.  We also want multiple JVMs installed. Here are the paths I use in Windows 7 x64:

64 Bit JVMs:

```
C:\Apps\Java64\jdk1.8.0_25
C:\Apps\Java64\jdk1.7.0_71
C:\Apps\Java64\jdk1.8.0_25
```

and one 32 bit JVM (for the browser):

```
C:\Apps\Java32\jre1.8.0_25
```

Note that one can set up shortcuts to run the ImageJ/Fiji Gui from the Quick Launch bar that are stored here:

```
%appdata%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch
```

I name the shortcuts `FijiJ6`, `FijiJ7`, and `FijiJ8`. Here are the entries for `FijiJ7`:

Target:

```
C:\Apps\Fiji.app.win64\ImageJ-win64.exe -Dpython.cachedir.skip=false --java-home "C:\Apps\Java64\jdk1.7.0_71" --
```

Run in:

```
C:\Apps\Fiji.app.win64
```

## Set up appropriate user environment variables.

Here are the User Environment variables I set from ``Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables``

```
BAD_DLL
C:/Users/%USERNAME%/AppData/Local/Temp/org.scijava.jython.shaded.jline_2_5_3.dll

EDS_ROOT
C:/Data/eds

FIJI_APP
C:/Apps/Fiji.app.win64/ImageJ-win64.exe

FIJI_JAVA_HOME
C:/Apps/Java64/jdk1.7.0_71/jre

GIT_HOME
C:/Users/%USERNAME%/Documents/git

GITHOME
